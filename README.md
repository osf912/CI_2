There is a button to reset the counter, if you like.

Font used is "Foggles" cursive, from Google Fonts to simulate a handwritten game.

## Testing

  - I've tested the site in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
  - I've confirmed that the site is responsive and I added an "Am I Responsive" screenshot to the readme.
  - I've checked that the links and the form works properly.

### HTML Validator Testing

  - confirmed.

### CSS Validator Testing

  - The contrast of the beige-color and the warm white was not acceptable for lighthouse, so I had to switch to a black font.
  - confirmed.

## Thanks to:

  - Google Font.
  - Code Institute for making me build this, and letting me use a few ideas and elements of the course.
