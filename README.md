# A simple Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe Game, where two persons can play Tic Tac Toe on the screen. If one wins the Game recognize that and count the wins for the player.

There is a button to reset the counter, if you like.

## Thanks to:

  - Google Font.
  - Code Institute for making me build this, and letting me use a few ideas and elements of the course.
  - YouTube (i.e. BroCode : A game of Tic Tac Toe written in javascript) for inspire me for the global variables WinSchemes and gameStatus and the checkWin() function.
